  <h1> All About Kombucha </h1>
  <p> Kombucha is a variety of fermented tea which has long been drank for its supposed health benefits. Kombucha is produced by using either black or green tea, sugar and a SCOBY (symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast). The SCOBY's yeast and bacterial populations ferments the sugar and results in its siganture low sugar content, vinegary smell and fizz! </p>
